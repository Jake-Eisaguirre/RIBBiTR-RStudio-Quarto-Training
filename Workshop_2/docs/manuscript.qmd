### Abstract

### Introduction

### Methods and Materials

We captured xx post-metamorphic *R. sierrae* (hereafter, "frogs") from Mesa Lake, Sierra National Forest, on August 15, 2023.
Frog snout-vent length was measured to the nearest millimeter using digital calipers and frogs were weighed to the nearest gram using a spring scale.
To describe the relationship between length and weight, we plotted log~10~(frog weight) against log~10~(frog length).

### Results

The relationship between frog length and weight was linear on a log~10~ scale and showed little scatter around the regression line.

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
